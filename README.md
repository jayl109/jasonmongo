This app allows you to see reported pokemon in pokemongo from crowdsourced data on a map. 
You can add your own pokemon to the database (only at your current location) by clicking add a pokemon and typing a name.
As of now, every pokemon sprite is a lapras but that will change later on. Click the lapras to see the actual pokemon at that location.
